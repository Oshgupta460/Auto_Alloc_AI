**Proposal:** Use 500 hours of GPU time for a new LLM training run

**Evaluation:** The success predictor tool indicates a high probability of success (1.00) for the proposed experiment, given the allocated 500 hours of GPU time and assumed data size of 1000 GB.

**Recommendation:** Based on the predicted high success probability, we recommend funding this proposal. The predicted success probability suggests that the allocated resources are sufficient to achieve a successful outcome, and the experiment has the potential to lead to significant scientific breakthroughs.

**Rationale:** The high success probability predicted by the tool suggests that the experiment is well-resourced and has a high likelihood of achieving its objectives. Given the potential for significant scientific breakthroughs, we believe that funding this proposal is a worthwhile investment.

**Conclusion:** We recommend proceeding with the proposed experiment, using 500 hours of GPU time for the new LLM training run."

Introduction:
The proposal to use 500 hours of GPU time for a new LLM training run has been evaluated. The success predictor tool was utilized to assess the probability of success for this experiment.

Methodology:
The success predictor tool was called with the specified parameters: 500 compute hours and 1000 GB data size. The tool predicted a probability of success.

Results:
The predicted probability of success for the proposed experiment is 0.00, indicating a very low likelihood of achieving the desired outcomes.

Discussion:
Given the low predicted probability of success, it is essential to reconsider the allocation of resources for this project. The predicted outcome suggests that the current approach may not yield significant scientific breakthroughs.

Recommendation:
Based on the analysis, it is recommended to pivot from the current proposal. The low predicted probability of success indicates that the resources could be more effectively utilized for alternative projects with higher potential for scientific breakthroughs.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the proposal to use 500 hours of GPU time for a new LLM training run does not meet the requirements for a high-potential project. It is advisable to explore alternative projects that can maximize the scientific breakthrough potential. 

Should we fund this or pivot? PIVOT."
