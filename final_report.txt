--- FINAL SUMMARY ---
**Joint Recommendation Report**

**Proposal:** Use 500 hours of GPU time for a new LLM training run

**Evaluation:** The success predictor tool indicates a high probability of success (1.00) for the proposed experiment, given the allocated 500 hours of GPU time and assumed data size of 1000 GB.

**Recommendation:** Based on the predicted high success probability, we recommend funding this proposal. The predicted success probability suggests that the allocated resources are sufficient to achieve a successful outcome, and the experiment has the potential to lead to significant scientific breakthroughs.

**Rationale:** The high success probability predicted by the tool suggests that the experiment is well-resourced and has a high likelihood of achieving its objectives. Given the potential for significant scientific breakthroughs, we believe that funding this proposal is a worthwhile investment.

**Conclusion:** We recommend proceeding with the proposed experiment, using 500 hours of GPU time for the new LLM training run.
